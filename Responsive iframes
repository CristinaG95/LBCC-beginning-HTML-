      Jay Watson and Ambrose Kenny-Smith lead parallel musical lives you
      wouldn't necessarily expect to intersect. At surface level, they're
      working at opposite ends of a spectrum: Watson skews toward chilled-out
      neo-psychedelia, touring with Tame Impala, playing in Pond and flying solo
      as GUM, while Kenny-Smith brings late '60s garage and blues rock intensity
      to Melbourne's King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, even more in the
      Murlocs. It's a wonder they found the time to come together, and a welcome
      surprise they did. Vintage, contemporary and futuristic all at once, Ill
      Times is a well-constructed collage: they threw everything at the wall,
      and all of it stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, their collaboration was kismet. Longing to lean deeper into funk,
      Watson spent years workshopping a gritty synth instrumental to no avail.
      Sent to Kenny-Smith on a whim, it effortlessly morphed into "Old
      Transistor Radio," a fuzzy ode to the inexplicable power of music, its
      energy a brattier "Old Time Rock and Roll" for '90s babies. Riding a
      zig-zagging synthline and crunchy hip-hop drums, Kenny-Smith waxes mystic
      about "high frequencies I can't describe" between some manic adlibs and
      screeches. With radio static and an interpolation of the stacked harmonica
      and sax from Eric Burdon & War's "Magic Mountain," it lives up to being on
      "another dimension on the static dial."

        seven?</strong
      ><br />
      Oh it was really fun, really easy. He’s used to having to do stuff so
      quickly with them (KG).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Was it completely remote?</strong><br />
      Yeah completely remote, we’ve almost finished an album. It’s really cool,
      it’s been really easy. It’s insane how quickly I’ll send him something and
      then how quickly he’ll send some vocals back. So I’ll just spend a couple
      months fiddling with the production and mixing on it and then it should be
      done… I don’t know how to describe it, it’s kinda like an Electro Soul
      Rock record."<br />

      Occupies a ‘spotlight’ role and provides the group’s signature harmonica
      wail, and live keys/secondary percussion duties. Has the second most lead
      vocal and songwriting credits, and occasionally plays alto saxophone.
      Ambrose is also the principal member of The Murlocs, a Garage/Blues Rock
      band featuring Cook on bass, with Cal Shortal, Tim Karmouche, and Matt
      Blach playing guitar, keyboards, and drums respectively. Formed shortly
      before Ambrose joined King Gizzard, as his primary project they have
      maintained a very respectable and distinctive output in between other
      commitments. The material is a less conceptual, more straightforward
      reflection of Ambrose; and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of the
      idiosyncratic vocal timbre and signature harmonica wail that has come to
      define his contributions for King Gizzard.

      “After my Dad passed away in May last year, we never got to properly
      finish the song together” explains Ambrose “It only felt right to make the
      chorus as more of a sendoff to him. I miss him everyday but Iʼm so glad I
      now have this song to remember him by. It helped me process his passing a
      lot. Dad used to always sign off on his emails and birthday cards with ʻ-
      love Dud x.ʼ”
    </p>
    <p>
      GUM’s Jay Watson adds: “This one started as a demo Ambrose sent me, with
      the songwriting all there. I loved the melody and the classic chord
      progression, and ran about half of the stems through a tremolo, as well as
      adding some Vox repeater fuzz tremolo, a classic Spacemen 3 trick. It just
      sounded like Track 1 to me, I donʼt know why.”
