      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Cristina Garcia and I am newly 30 years old, trying to
        make a career in web development but open to other coding languages like
        SQL and Python.
      </p>
      <section id="education">
        <h3>Education and career goals</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from Paramount High School in 2013 with a focus on graphic
          design. Since then, I have been attending LBCC on and off, focusing on
          different majors to see what sticks. These majors include theater
          arts, music, medical billing, and now web development full-stack. I
          have always loved working with computers, and my educational goal is
          to get a career where I can work at a desk and hopefully earn enough
          to support my parents.
        </p>

            <p>
              My interests include playing video games and watching cartoons.
              When I have the time and money, I like to go to concerts. Mostly
              local venues, but I only really splurge on one band, King Gizzard
              & the Lizard Wizard. I've been going to King Gizzard concerts for
              3 years, soon to be 4 years in a row, and I like to collect
              posters from the shows I go to.

              <h4>Websites I like</h4>
              <u1>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>
                  <p>
                    I like Bandcamp as a website because of how easy it is to
                    navigate and find new artists, thanks to the open grid
                    layout when displaying the album art.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://kglw.net/">KGLW.net</a>
                  <p>
                    I like KGLW.net because it is a fan-made free resource where
                    I can go and see any new updates or articles that may have
                    come up about King Gizzard.
