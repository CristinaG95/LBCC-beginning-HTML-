      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>
        Development began in 2021, two and a half years before release, and the
        game was initially intended to be one of several small games that were
        shared with friends. After seeing the number of roguelike deckbuilders
        on Steam and after watching a Twitch stream of Northernlion playing Luck
        Be a Landlord, a slot machine-themed roguelike, he was inspired to turn
        his Big Two clone into a single-player roguelike deckbuilder without
        online play. He at one point considered the name Joker Poker for the
        game before settling on balatro, a professional jester or buffoon.
      </p>
      <h2>Playthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Balatro is a roguelike deck-building game. The player chooses a deck,
        each with unique effects and cards, before each playthrough or "run." A
        run is divided into antes, with three blinds, each of increasing
        difficulty. A blind consists of multiple rounds, where the player has to
        utilize various combinations of cards to score at least the required
        amount of points. To defeat blinds more easily, the player may choose to
        buy various cards that change the rules of the game. These items are
        bought in a shop in between rounds.
      </p>
      <h2>Cards</h2>

      <p>
        Jokers are the primary means by which players can alter their scoring in
        the game, among other effects. The game was released with 150 Joker
        cards. Many Jokers provide Chips or Mult bonuses based on certain
        conditions, and some provide an additional Mult multipliers. Other
        Jokers can reward money or consumable cards on meeting their conditions.
        Jokers can be found with or upgraded to variants like Foil, Polychrome,
        Negative or Holographic versions which provide further bonuses. Part of
        the strategy of Balatro is filling one's limited Joker slots with Jokers
        that have interactions with each other and other cards to greatly
        increase scoring opportunities.
